<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

Have you ever received your score and wondered what the final mark is, but it is not uploaded to your student information system? Or does Google Classroom not display your final mark? ossd-mark-calculator calculates your mark with speed and accuracy. 

It is built with C++, which is faster than most languages. The program avoids using decimals during its calculation, which produces 100% accurate results.  

If you find this helpful (thank you for using ossd-mark-calculator), [staring this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) would help the author a lot!

## Running the calculator

1. [**Click here to download**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udontur/ossd-mark-calculator/main/ossd-markcal.exe)
2. Click ```ossd-markcal.exe``` on the download pop up (**top left corner**) 
3. Click ```More Info```, then click ```Run anyway```. (This program is **safe**. You can check the code in [the src folder](src))
