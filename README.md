<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

Have you ever received your score and wondered what the final mark is, but it is not uploaded to your student information system? Or does Google Classroom not display your final mark? ossd-mark-calculator calculates your mark with speed and accuracy. 

üéØ It is built with C++. The program avoids using decimals during its calculation, which produces 100% accurate results. 

## Running the calculator

1. [**Click here to download**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udontur/ossd-mark-calculator/main/app/ossd-mark-cal.exe)
2. Click ```ossd-markcal.exe``` on the download pop up (**top left corner**) 
3. Click ```More Info```, then click ```Run anyway```. (This program is **safe**. You can check the code in [the src folder](src))
4. A terminal will pop up, ossd-mark-calculator is good to go!

## Usage

1. "Enter the number of items"
    - Type how many marks you want to enter.
2. "Enter the marks" (Limit: 4 decimal points)

    - For example: ```4 9.5 1000 99.332 20```.
3. "Enter the denominators" (Limit: 1 decimal point)
    - Type your denominators according to the order of the marks, separated by a space.
4. "Enter the weights" (Limit: 0 decimal points)
    - Type your weights according to the order of the marks, separated by a space.
